            <img src="mygal.png" alt="art gallery welcome image" width="500">

            <p>This online gallery was created to share my artwork with the world in a simple, modern, and meaningful space. Every piece displayed here reflects my passion for color, storytelling, and emotion.</p>

            <p>I am <strong>Aisha Alkhaderi</strong>, a designer and visual communication student who loves exploring creativity through painting, digital art, and expressive visuals. My gallery acts as a small corner of the internet where ideas and art meet.</p>

            <p>The gallery is designed as a calm, minimal venue — a place where the focus stays on the artwork itself. Visitors can explore my collection, learn about each piece, and experience the emotions behind every brushstroke.</p>

            <p>As I continue growing as an artist, this gallery will grow with me. New artworks, new colors, and new stories will always find a home here.</p>
